normalizer.sh will add a new audio track to a movie file that contains the original sound track butwith normalized volume.

This takes away some of the audio quality but makes casual viewing much more enjoyable.

I have no idea what happens if your video already has multiple audio tracks available.

Surround sound is mixed down to stereo.

The lower, normalized, track has a smaller range in volume between the quietest and loudest sections compared to the original.
